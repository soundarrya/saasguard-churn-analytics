# KPI Insights – Where Value is Being Lost

We didn't measure churn by looking at who canceled their subscription or sent a complaint email. That's too late.

**We measured churn by tracking when customers stop getting value from the product.**

And in a SaaS dashboard product, value = dashboard usage.

Here are the three key metrics that tell the story:

---

## KPI 1 – Daily Active Accounts (The Heartbeat)

**What it measures:** How many accounts are actually using the product each day.

**Why it matters:**

Let's say your company has 1,000 paying customers. Sounds great, right?

But if you look at Daily Active Accounts and only 150 accounts opened a dashboard today... **your real adoption is 15%, not 100%.**

**This is the reality check metric:**
- Are customers just paying for the product, or are they *using* it?
- Is the product becoming part of their daily workflow, or gathering dust?

**Think of it like this:** You can have a gym membership (paying customer) but never go to the gym (inactive account). The gym still gets your money, but you're a churn risk because you're not getting value.

**Daily Active Accounts is the heartbeat of the platform.** If it's strong and steady, the product is healthy. If it's declining, something's wrong.

## KPI 2 – Rolling 30-Day Usage Drop (The Warning Sign)

**What it measures:** How much dashboard usage has declined in the last 30 days compared to the 30 days before that.

**Why it matters:**

This is where we catch churn risk *before* it becomes actual churn.

**Here's how it works:**

We compare two time windows:
- **Days 31-60 ago** (the "before" period)
- **Last 30 days** (the "now" period)

**The formula:**
```
Drop Rate = 1 - (Recent 30 Days Usage / Previous 30 Days Usage)
```

**Real example:**

**FinNova Corp:**
- Days 31-60 ago: 200 dashboard views
- Last 30 days: 80 dashboard views
- Drop Rate = 1 - (80/200) = **60% decline**

**What this tells us:** FinNova used to be an engaged customer. Now they're barely using the product. Something changed.

**This is the churn signal.** High drop rate = value is collapsing = customer is about to leave.

**Why 30 days?**
- Long enough to see a real trend (not just a vacation week)
- Short enough that there's still time to intervene

## KPI 3 – Churn Risk Ranking (The Action Plan)

**What it measures:** Automatically classifies every account into risk categories.

**Why it matters:**

Customer Success teams don't have time to dig through usage data for 1,000 accounts every day. They need a simple answer: **Who should I call today?**

**This KPI gives them exactly that:**

| Risk Tier | What It Means | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| **HIGH RISK** | Dashboard usage has nearly disappeared. Value is almost gone. | **Call them TODAY.** This account is about to churn. |
| **MEDIUM RISK** | Usage is declining significantly. They're losing interest. | **Reach out this week.** Check in, offer help, re-engage. |
| **LOW RISK** | Healthy, steady usage. They're getting value. | **Leave them alone.** Focus on at-risk accounts. |

**Real-world example:**

**Monday morning Customer Success meeting:**

*"We have 15 HIGH RISK accounts this week worth $250K in ARR. Here's the list with reasons why they're flagged. Start calling today."*

Instead of guessing who to call or doing random check-ins, the team knows *exactly* where to focus their time.

## Why These KPIs Work Together

Each metric tells part of the story:

**Daily Active Accounts** → Is the platform healthy overall?  
**Rolling 30-Day Drop** → Which accounts are declining?  
**Churn Risk Ranking** → Who needs intervention right now?

**Together, they create a complete churn early warning system:**
1. Monitor the overall health (DAA)
2. Detect declining value (Drop Rate)
3. Prioritize action (Risk Ranking)

## The Business Impact

**Before these KPIs:**
- Customer Success does random check-ins
- Customers cancel without warning
- Teams are always reacting, never preventing

**After these KPIs:**
- Customer Success focuses on high-risk accounts
- Churn is caught early while there's time to save the relationship
- Teams are proactive, strategic, and data-driven

**This is the difference between:**
- "We lost FinNova today—didn't see it coming" (reactive)
- "FinNova's usage dropped 60% last month—we called them, identified the issue, and got them re-engaged" (proactive)

## What This Shows About My Approach

I didn't just build reports—I built a system that changes how Customer Success operates:

✓ **Simple enough** that non-technical teams can understand it  
✓ **Actionable enough** that they know exactly what to do  
✓ **Predictive enough** that they can prevent churn instead of just reacting to it  

**These aren't vanity metrics.** They're the KPIs that protect revenue and keep customers successful.

And that's what real business analytics looks like.
