# Business Case Study: Enterprise SaaS Churn Early Warning

## 1) The Real-World Problem

Here's something most people don't realize about SaaS cancellations: **customers don't wake up one day and suddenly decide to cancel.**

There's a pattern that happens slowly, quietly, over weeks:

**The Churn Timeline:**
1. Team signs up excited about the product
2. Usage is high at first—everyone's building dashboards, analyzing data
3. Slowly, people stop logging in as much
4. Dashboards stop getting opened
5. The product becomes "that tool we don't really use anymore"
6. Finance reviews subscriptions and cancels it

**By the time you get the cancellation notice, the relationship died weeks ago.**

The most telling signal? **Dashboard usage.** If people stop viewing dashboards, they've stopped getting value from the product.

This project is about catching that moment *before* the cancellation happens.

## 2) What We're Actually Trying to Solve

**The core question every SaaS company needs to answer:**

> "Which of our enterprise customers are using dashboards less and less over the last 30 days—and are now at risk of churning?"

**Why 30 days?** That's the window where:
- The decline is noticeable
- There's still time to intervene
- Customer Success can reach out before the decision is made

**Why dashboards specifically?** Because in most SaaS products, dashboards are the core value delivery mechanism. If users aren't looking at their data, they're not getting value. Period.

## 3) Who Cares About This (And Why)

This isn't just a "nice to have" metric—it's critical for multiple teams:

| Team | Why This Matters to Them |
|---|---|
| **Customer Success** | They need to know *who* to call and *why*. "Your team hasn't opened a dashboard in 3 weeks—can we help?" is a lot more effective than random check-in calls. |
| **Product Team** | They need to understand which features are losing engagement and why. If dashboard usage drops after a UI update, that's a red flag. |
| **Finance / Revenue** | They need to protect Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). Every churn is lost revenue. Early detection = more saves = stable revenue forecasts. |
| **Sales Team** | Healthy usage = expansion opportunities. If an account is thriving, that's a potential upsell. If they're declining, don't push for more—focus on retention. |

**Everyone wins when you catch churn risk early.**

## 4) What Happens If We Don't Fix This

Let's be honest about the cost of ignoring declining usage:

**Higher churn rate**
- Customers leave without warning
- Customer Success is always reacting, never preventing

**Lost upsell opportunities**
- You can't expand accounts that are disengaged
- Revenue growth stalls

**Unpredictable revenue**
- Finance can't forecast accurately when churn is random
- Investor confidence drops

**Unstable pipeline**
- Sales has to replace churned revenue constantly
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) skyrockets because you're replacing customers instead of keeping them

**The brutal truth:** In SaaS, acquiring a new customer costs 5-7x more than keeping an existing one.

**Value-based churn is the silent killer.** Customers quietly stop using the product, and by the time you notice, they're already gone.

## 5) What "Winning" Looks Like

Success isn't abstract—it's measurable and actionable:

**Before this system:**
- Customer Success gets a cancellation notice
- They scramble to save the account
- Usually fail because the customer already made up their mind weeks ago

**After this system:**
- Analytics flags declining dashboard usage automatically
- Customer Success reaches out proactively: "Hey, noticed your team hasn't been using dashboards much—is everything okay? Can we help?"
- They catch the problem while there's still time to fix it

**The measurable outcomes:**

✓ **Churn risk flagged BEFORE the account decides to leave**  
✓ **Customer Success has time to intervene and re-engage**  
✓ **Product team identifies which features are losing value and why**  
✓ **Finance can forecast revenue more accurately**  
✓ **Sales knows which accounts are healthy vs. at-risk**

## The Key Insight

**By monitoring just one feature—dashboard views—we can predict churn with high accuracy.**

Why? Because dashboard usage is a proxy for value. If customers are looking at their data, they're getting value. If they stop looking, they've stopped caring.

**This isn't about tracking every click.** It's about identifying the one behavior that signals "this customer is losing interest."

## Why This Case Study Matters

This isn't just a technical project—it's a demonstration of business thinking:

**I understand:**
- How SaaS companies actually make money (retention > acquisition)
- What metrics matter to different stakeholders (CS, Product, Finance, Sales)
- How to frame a technical solution as a business solution
- That the goal isn't just to "analyze data"—it's to protect revenue and help customers succeed

**This is what separates data analysts from business analysts:**
- Data analysts build reports
- Business analysts build solutions that change how companies operate

This project shows I can do both.
